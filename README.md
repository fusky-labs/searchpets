## Tech stack

![Searchpets Stack](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=react,nextjs,ts,js,sass,tailwind,py,flask,cloudflare)

The front-end is written in a React framework, Next.js + TypeScript;
with Tailwind CSS and Sass as CSS painkillers. For the back-end, it's powered
with Python with the lightweight web framework, Flask.

The website is currently being hosted from a custom Linode server and
delivered through the interwebs with CloudFlare.

## Project structure

- `app` - Next.js app, bootstrapped with Tailwind CSS and Sass
- `server` - Python backend, mostly responsible with auto-updaters and gathering
  Housepets database
- `scripts` - Automated Bash scripts to bulk install Python and Node packages and
  for deployment from the server

## Running the app locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 14 or higher (LTS recommended)
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git Bash or WSL (for Windows only, required to execute Bash scripts)
- Yarn Package Manager (npm can still be used but we strongly recommend using
  yarn!)

### Installation

The installation was complicated and will be automated via Bash script.
To install all the required Node and Python libraries, execute the `setup.sh`
file.

```console
sh scripts/setup.sh
```

Once all the libraries have been installed, it will execute `gen.py` to
generate a JSON file containing Housepets! data. (This will take a while!)

Once it's finished, simply run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to
concurrently start both Node and Python servers.
